This is ***Yue***. A senior Physics student in ***SJTU***. I'm interested in ***quantum computation*** and currently have some experience in finding new way to encode information into quantum states(AQEC), and also in entangling 2 quantum computers with Bell-state measurement. I'm now applying for a PHD overseas. If you are keen of what I do, feel free to contact me!
